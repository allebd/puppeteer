# Puppeteer
An example for my Puppeteer tutorial

## Prerequisites
* NodeJS installed
* Basic knowledge of the command line
* Knowledge of JavaScript
* knowledge of the DOM.

Note: Your scraper code doesn’t have to be perfect. When doing your own projects don’t overthink it.

## Project Setup
* Make a folder ( name it whatever )
* Open the folder in your terminal / command prompt
* In your terminal run, npm init -y This will generate a package.json for managing project dependencies.
* Then run npm install puppeteer This will install puppeteer which includes Chromium so don’t be surprised if it’s large.
* Finally, open the folder in your favorite code editor and create an index.js file. You’ll also need these folders;screenshots, pdfs, and json if you’re following my example exactly.
